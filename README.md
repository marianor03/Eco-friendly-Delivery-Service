- 📍 Graph-based map with real UK city connections
- 🔁 Multiple search algorithms:
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Dijkstra’s Algorithm
  - A* Search
  - Simulated Annealing (Advanced Optimization)
- 🛣️ Simulated traffic conditions to model real-world delays
- 🌱 Focus on sustainability and emission reduction
- 🔐 Ethical design with transparency and user awareness

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User selects a start and end city from a list of predefined locations.
2. The system builds a graph of cities and roads with distances.
3. Algorithms are run to find optimal paths:
   - BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, and A* search are used for standard routing.
   - Simulated Annealing offers a globally optimized route.
4. Traffic conditions are applied via random distance multipliers.
5. Final routes and distances are displayed for comparison.
